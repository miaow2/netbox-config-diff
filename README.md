# NetBox Config Diff Plugin

[NetBox](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox) plugin for Config Diff.

* Free software: Apache-2.0
* Documentation: https://miaow2.github.io/netbox-config-diff/

<!--about-start-->
## About

### Collecting diffs

With this plugin you can find diff between the rendered configuration for a device to its actual configuration, retrieved from the device itself, or stored in DataSource.
Read about [DataSources](https://demo.netbox.dev/static/docs/models/core/datasource/) for further details.

Device configuration renders natively in NetBox. This [feature](https://demo.netbox.dev/static/docs/features/configuration-rendering/) was introduced in 3.5 version.
 NetBox Labs [blog](https://netboxlabs.com/blog/how-to-generate-device-configurations-with-netbox/) post about it.

Plugin supports a wide list of vendors (Cisco, Juniper, Huawei, MicroTik etc.) with the help of Scrapli. Read [Scrapli](https://carlmontanari.github.io/scrapli/user_guide/project_details/#supported-platforms) and [scrapli-community](https://scrapli.github.io/scrapli_community/user_guide/project_details/#supported-platforms) documentations to find full list of vendors.

### Pushing configuration

Also you can push rendered configuration from NetBox to device and apply it.

Supported platforms:

* `arista_eos`
* `cisco_iosxe`
* `cisco_iosxr`
* `cisco_nxos`
* `juniper_junos`

This is possible thanks to the scrapli_cfg. Read [Scrapli](https://github.com/scrapli/scrapli_cfg/) documentation for more info.

Enable the plugin in `/opt/netbox/netbox/netbox/configuration.py`,
 or if you use netbox-docker, your `/configuration/plugins.py` file,
 and define credentials for devices connection:

```python
PLUGINS = [
    "netbox_config_diff",
]

PLUGINS_CONFIG = {
    "netbox_config_diff": {
        "USERNAME": "foo",
        "PASSWORD": "bar",
    },
}
```

Run database migrations:
